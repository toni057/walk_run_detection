## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(purrr)
library(magrittr)
library(FactoMineR)
library(factoextra)

# load dataset
d <- read_csv('dataset.csv')

```

# Exploration

Show first several rows of data

```{r load data, echo=FALSE}

head(d)

```

## ploting data

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
